Undertake a competitive analysis the assigned Dunnhumby Carboload category (PASTA) from the point of view of the assigned brand (MUELLER). Category and brand assignments will be made during the semester (Now done, as PASTA and MUELLER). The main tasks are:

1. Download the Dunnhumby carboload .csv files and combines into an SQL database.

2. Write an SQL query to extract and save a .csv file containing relevant category data.

3. Use Python and Jupyter notebooks to clean the data (watch out for partial time periods!).

4. Use Python and Jupyter notebooks to create build a customer dashboard for the focal brand, competitive performance and trends in category demand.

5. Using data from the last complete quarter, apply the Dirichlet spreadsheet by Kearns to derive theoretical benchmarks, including measures of model fit.
